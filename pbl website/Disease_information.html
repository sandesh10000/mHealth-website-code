                The exact cause of asthma is unknown, and the causes may vary from person to person. However, asthma is often the result of a strong response of the immune system to a substance in the lungs. To understand asthma, it helps to understand How the Lungs Work.
Normally, the body’s immune system helps to fight infections. Sometimes a person’s immune system responds to a substance in the environment called an allergen. When someone breathes in an allergen, such as ragweed, the immune system in the airways may react strongly. Other people exposed to the same substance may not react at all.
The immune system reacts to an allergen by creating inflammation. Inflammation makes your airways swell and narrow and possibly produce more mucus. This can make it harder to breathe. The muscles around the airways may also tighten, which is called a bronchospasm. This can make it even harder to breathe.
Over time, the airway walls can become thicker. The image below shows how airways narrow during asthma.

                If you are diagnosed with asthma, your doctor will work with you to create a treatment plan to manage your asthma symptoms and prevent asthma attacks. Treatment usually depends on your age, asthma severity, and response to a given treatment option. Your doctor may adjust your treatment until asthma symptoms are controlled.
                Most people are treated long-term with daily controller(s), along with another inhaler for short-term relief, when they have symptoms or to prevent symptoms. An inhaler allows the medicine to go into the mouth and airwaysexternal link.
                Short-term relief medicines, also called quick-relief medicines, help prevent symptoms or relieve symptoms during an asthma attack. They may be the only medicines needed for mild asthma or asthma that happens only with physical activity.

                    Insomnia is a common sleep disorder. With insomnia, you may have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or getting good quality sleep. This happens even though you have the time and the right environment to sleep well. Insomnia interferes with your daily activities, and may make you feel unrested or sleepy during the day. 
                    Short-term insomnia may be caused by stress or changes in your schedule or environment. It can last for a few days or weeks. Chronic (long-term) insomnia occurs three or more nights a week, lasts more than three months, and cannot be fully explained by another health problem or a medicine. 
                    To diagnose insomnia, your doctor may ask about your sleep habits and ask you to keep a sleep diary. Your doctor may recommend healthy lifestyle habits such as a regular sleep schedule, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, and medicines to help you manage your insomnia.
                    Insomnia can affect your memory and concentration. Chronic insomnia raises your risk of high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.

            <ul>
                <li>1.Lie awake for a long time before you fall asleep. This is more common in younger adults.</li>
                <li>2.Sleep for only short periods. You may wake up often during the night or be awake for most of the night.
                     This is the most common symptom and affects mostly older adults.</li>
                <li>3.Wake up too early in the morning and not be able to get back to sleep.</li>
                <li>4.Have poor-quality sleep. You may wake up feeling unrested, and you may feel sleepy during the day. You may also have 
                    trouble focusing on tasks. Insomnia can cause you to feel anxious, depressed, or irritable. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition, chronic insomnia can affect how well your brain, heart, and other parts of your body work. It can raise your risk of 
                certain health problems or make existing problems worse. These conditions include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1.Breathing problems such as asthma</li>
            <li>2.Heart problems such as arrhythmia, heart failure, coronary heart disease, and high blood pressure</li>
            <li>3.Pain. People who have chronic pain and insomnia may become more aware of and distressed by their pain.</li>
            <li>4.Pregnancy complications such as having more pain during labor, giving birth preterm, needing a cesarean
                 section (C-section), and having a baby with low birth weight.</li>
            <li>5.Problems with your immune system, your body’s natural defense against germs and sickness. These problems 
                can lead to inflammation in your body or make it harder to fight infections.</li>

                    Lifestyle changes can often help improve short-term insomnia. A type of counseling called cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is
                     usually the first treatment recommended for chronic insomnia. Several medicines can also help manage insomnia and help you have a regular 
                     sleep schedule. You may need to visit a doctor who specializes in treating sleep problems.

                <li>4.Eat meals on a regular schedule and avoid late-night dinners. This helps maintain a regular sleep-wake cycle.</li>
                <li>5.Relaxation or meditation therapy to teach you how to relax and fall asleep faster.</li>
                <li>6.Sleep restriction therapy, which gives you a specific amount of time to spend in bed, whether or not you are able to sleep during this time.
                     With time, this helps you sleep better when you go to bed. Your sleep time can be increased when you start to sleep better.</li>

                High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is a common disease that develops when blood flows through your arteries at 
                higher-than-normal pressures. Your blood pressure is made up of two numbers: systolic and diastolic. Systolic pressure is the pressure when 
                the ventricles pump blood out of the heart. Diastolic pressure is the pressure between heartbeats when the heart is filling with blood.  
                Your blood pressure changes throughout the day based on your activities. For most adults, a normal blood pressure is less than 120 over 80 
                millimeters of mercury, which is written as your systolic pressure reading over your diastolic pressure reading—120/80 mm Hg. Your blood 
                pressure is considered high when you have consistent systolic readings of 130 mm Hg or higher or diastolic readings of 80 mm Hg or higher.

                <p>It is important to have regular blood pressure readings taken and to know your numbers, because high blood pressure usually does not 
                    cause symptoms until it has caused serious problems.Undiagnosed or uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to serious health problems:</p>

            <p>
                
                    For most people with high blood pressure, a doctor will develop a treatment plan that may include heart-healthy lifestyle changes 
                    alone or with medicines. A risk calculator can help your doctor estimate your risk of complications and choose the right treatment. 
                    A healthcare team can help you best manage your blood pressure and prevent complications. This team may include your doctor, a nutritionist,
                     a pharmacist, and specialists for any conditions you may have, including those related to your heart.
                    If your high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or medicine, it may improve once the cause is treated or removed.  
                
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1.Choose heart-healthy foods such as those in the DASH eating plan. NHLBI-funded research has shown that DASH combined with a low-salt 
                eating plan can be as effective as medicines in lowering high blood pressure. Visit Living With the DASH Eating Plan or see Tips to Reduce 
                Salt and Sodium. </li>
            <li>2.Avoid or limit alcohol. Talk to your doctor about how much alcohol you drink. Your doctor may recommend that you limit or stop drinking 
                alcohol. You can find resources and support at the Alcohol Treatment Navigator from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. </li>
            <li> 3.Get regular physical activity. Many health benefits result from being physically active and getting the recommended amount of physical
                 activity each week. Studies have shown that physical activity can help lower and control high blood pressure levels. Even modest amounts 
                 of physical activity may help. Before starting any exercise program, ask your doctor what level of physical activity is right for you</li>
            <li>4.Aim for a healthy weight. If you are an adult who is living with overweight or obesity, losing 5% to 10% of your initial weight over about
                 6 months can improve your health. Even losing just 3% to 5% of your weight can improve blood pressure readings. </li>
            <li> 5.Manage stress. Learning how to manage stress and cope with problems can improve your mental and physical health. Learning relaxation techniques, 
                talking to a counselor, and finding a support group can all help.</li>
            <li> 6.Diuretics to remove extra water and sodium (salt) from your body, reducing the amount of fluid in your blood. The main diuretic for high blood pressure 
                treatment is thiazide. Diuretics are often used with other high blood pressure medicines, sometimes in one combined pill.</li>
